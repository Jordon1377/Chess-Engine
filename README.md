# Chess-Engine
First attempt at a Chess Engine using the Min-Max Algorithm in Unity
To see scripts go to assets fold and scripts folder
To try the game click the Chess Game file! -Note: The game is only set at a mini max depth of 3 due to most computers not being able to run higher recursive depth searches at efficient speeds.
