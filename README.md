# Chess-Engine
First attempt at a Chess Engine using the Min-Max Algorithm in Unity.
To see scripts go to Assets --> Scripts.
To try the game download and run the Chess-Game.exe file! 
- Note: The game is only set at a mini max depth of 3 due to most computers not being able to run higher recursive depth searches at efficient speeds.
